    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about" class="section about-section">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            The **Secretary of Climate Resilience** was established to position Madrid as a global leader in addressing the complex challenges posed by climate change. Our mission is to safeguard the city and its citizens from the impacts of extreme weather, including heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms, while fostering sustainable urban development.
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, the Secretary's work revolves around **prevention, adaptation, and response**. We design and implement innovative programs that address current risks and anticipate future challenges. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, policy innovation, and community engagement, we aim to create a city that is more resilient, inclusive, and prepared for a changing climate.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key areas of focus include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mitigating Heat Stress:</strong> Through urban cooling initiatives like nocturnal cooling systems, shaded public spaces, and tree planting programs, we work to reduce the urban heat island effect and improve the quality of life during heatwaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Flood Resilience:</strong> We redesign urban infrastructure with flood-ready streets, permeable pavements, and advanced drainage systems to protect citizens and properties from heavy rainfall and flash floods.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Resource Management:</strong> From smart water monitoring systems to greywater recovery programs, we prioritize the conservation and optimal use of one of our most precious resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy and Resource Resilience:</strong> With projects such as renewable microgrids and green roof initiatives, we promote sustainable energy use and ecological urban design that adapts to extreme climate conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Preparedness:</strong> The Secretary acts as the central hub for coordinating emergency responses to natural disasters, offering real-time alerts, refuge networks, and public resources during crises.</li>
            <li><strong>Education and Engagement:</strong> A resilient city is built on an informed and active citizenry. Our public workshops, school programs, and community brigades empower citizens to take proactive roles in their neighborhoods and adapt to climate challenges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Secretary of Climate Resilience is committed to **equity and inclusivity**. We recognize that vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of climate impacts, and we strive to design solutions prioritizing their safety, well-being, and access to resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Madrid’s future depends on the choices we make today. With a bold vision, decisive action, and collaboration between government, private entities, and citizens, we are transforming our city into a model of resilience and sustainability for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> A city where no one is left behind in the fight against climate change. A Madrid that thrives, adapts, and leads by example.</p>
